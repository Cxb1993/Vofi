                  VOFI Library
                  ============

The  VOFI library initializes the volume fraction scalar field 
in a computational mesh with cubic cells given an analytic expression 
f(x,y,z) for the interface. The implicit function f is specified
by the user, the interface is located where f(x,y,z) = 0 and 
the reference phase where f(x,y,z) < 0. 
Each routine in the directory src contains a brief description
of what it does and of the I/O variables. 

vofi-specific configuration options
======================================


Build Process
-------------

[1] Extract vofi_lib.tgz archive into any temporary directory

[2] Choose a local (e.g. /home/username) or system (e.g. /usr/local)
    destination for '/installing_directory' which is write-able

[3] ./configure --prefix=/installing_directory

[4] make all
    (to build the library and to compile tests) 

    if separately:

    make lib 
    (to build only the library) 

    make demo
    (to compile all C, Fortran, CPP tests)

    make demo-c (or demo-f or demo-cpp)
    (to compile only C (or Fortran or CPP) tests) 

[5] make tests
    (to run all C, Fortran and CPP tests)
   
    if separately:

    make tests-c (or tests-f or tests-cpp)
    (to run only C (or Fortran or CPP) tests) 

[6] make install
    (if the /installing_directory is /usr/local, then
    libvofi.a will be located in /usr/local/lib64, 
    while vofi.h in /usr/local/include)


Requirements
------------

The vofi library has no particular requirement other than a 
reasonably modern C, Fortran and C++ compiler  


Notes
-----

The two interface functions get_fh and get_cc, that are used 
in Fortran codes, are compiled both with no underscore and 
with a single underscore, i.e. get_fh_ and get_cc_, for 
compatibility with most compilers. If another version is 
required, the relevant changes should be made in the include 
file stddecl.h  and in makefile.in
