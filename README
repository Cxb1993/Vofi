                  VOFI Library
                  ============

The  VOFI library initializes the volume fraction scalar field 
in a computational mesh with cubic cells given an analytic expression 
f(x,y,z) for the interface. The implicit function f is specified
by the user, the interface is located where f(x,y,z) = 0 and 
the reference phase where f(x,y,z) < 0. 
Each routine in the directory src contains a brief description
of what it does and of the I/O variables. 

vofi-specific configuration options
======================================


Build Process
-------------

[1] ./configure --prefix=/installing_directory

[2] make all
    (to build the library and to compile tests) 

    if separately:

    make lib 
    (to build only the library) 

    make demo-c demo-f demo-cpp
    (to compile C, Fortran, CPP tests, respectively)

[3] make check
    (to run all C, Fortran and CPP tests)
   
    if separately:

    make runtests-c 
    (to run only C tests) 
    (for Fortran: make runtests-f, for CPP: make runtests-cpp ) 

4. make install
   (if the /installing_directory is /usr/local, then
    libvofi.a will be located in /usr/local/lib64, 
    while vofi.h in /usr/local/include)


Requirements
------------

The vofi library has no particular requirement other than a 
reasonably modern C, Fortran and C++ compiler.  


Notes
-----

The two interface functions get_fh and get_cc, that are used 
in Fortran codes, are compiled both with no underscore and 
with a single underscore, i.e. get_fh_ and get_cc_, for 
compatibility with most compilers. If another version is 
required, the relevant changes should be made in the include 
file stddecl.h  and in makefile.in
